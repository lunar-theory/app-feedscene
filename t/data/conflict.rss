      <description>This feed has a link that conflicts with another link, and
      has no GUID. This is common for blogs like Daring Fireball that link
      directly to other blogs in their feeds (although DF of course has decent
      GUIDs, so it shouldn't be a problem there, I just want to be
      careful.</description>
